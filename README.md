# Bank Fraud CPSC-312
Project for UBC CPSC 312 Class. This model is meant to learn the spending habits of an account 
and to predict when a new transaction is suspicious. Our tool will be able to document banking 
transactions such as purchases or withdrawals or deposit and will output whether or not this activity 
is suspicious based on previous transactions. This fraud detection model will look at different aspects 
of the transaction to determine if suspicious activity has occurred.

The following variables are analyzed:
* The transaction cost compared to the average transaction cost
* Amount spent in the day compared to the average previous daily expenditure 
* The country in which the transaction took place
* The name of the transaction
